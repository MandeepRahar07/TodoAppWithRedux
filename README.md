# TodoAppWithRedux
 we cover the following topics:

Setting up the project: We'll start by setting up a new React application with Redux for state management and Axios for handling HTTP requests. Don't worry if you're new to these technologies; we'll explain everything in detail.

Creating a TODO component: Learn how to design a clean and user-friendly TODO component using React. We'll implement features such as adding, editing, and marking tasks as complete.

Implementing Redux store: Integrate Redux into our application to manage the state of TODO items effectively. We'll cover actions, reducers, and store configuration.

Making GET requests: Connect our TODO app to a RESTful API and implement GET requests to fetch tasks from the server. You'll understand how to handle asynchronous data retrieval and display it in the UI.

Handling POST requests: Learn how to add new tasks by sending POST requests to the server. We'll guide you through the process of creating new tasks and updating the Redux store accordingly.

Deleting tasks: Implement the ability to delete completed tasks from the TODO list. We'll use DELETE requests to communicate with the server and manage the UI state accordingly.
